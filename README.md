Some tutorials to scrape different websites

In this repo, I have uploaded some sample codes to scrape data from different websites in a structured and secure way. 

All these scrapers are beginner friendly and consist of some betting scrapper, food-delivery scraper, ecommerce websites scraper. 

I hope these can give you an idea how to use different libraries to complete our task in a efficient way. 

Thanks
